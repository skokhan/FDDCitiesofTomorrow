# Fabric Data Days Notebooks Contest: The Cities of Tomorrow – Urban Growth & Sustainability

As the world’s population becomes increasingly urban, cities stand at the crossroads of innovation and environmental challenge. 
From smart infrastructure to green spaces, from urban sprawl to livability - the story of our cities is written in data.

## Challenge Overview
 
**Focus:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Predictive Modeling, and Data Storytelling.
Use Fabric Data Science Notebooks to uncover insights about how cities evolve, sustain, and innovate for the future.

### Objective

Create a Fabric Notebook that tells the data story of “The Cities of Tomorrow”.

The notebook should include:
* Data cleaning and preparation;
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA);
* Insight generation and (optional) predictive modeling;
* Markdown commentary to explain your findings and conclusions;
* The goal is to demonstrate how data science can help us understand - and imagine - more sustainable, livable cities.

### Dataset

**Primary Dataset:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmer3/sustainable-urban-planning-and-landscape-dataset](Sustainable Urban Planning & Landscape Dataset – Kaggle)
This dataset provides structured data for exploring sustainability, land use, infrastructure, and city-level environmental indicators - perfect for understanding how cities balance growth and livability.
 
**Example columns:**
Green Area %, Urban Density, Transport Infrastructure Score, Renewable Energy Index, Pollution Index, Livability Index
 
**Optional Supplementary Sources:**
World Bank Urban Development Indicators
UN-Habitat Urban Data Portal
